The theme toggle updates the button's text based on the current theme dynamically.\n3. **HTML Structure**: Streamlined the structure, removing extra divs and unnecessary complexity in function calls.\n\n**Note:** This template uses a simplistic approach; depending on your actual application setup (static files, external JavaScript, and CSS), you might want to expand or modularize parts of this code. Ensure that `url_for` is functioning as intended for loading resources if you're using Flask as your backend. This code assumes that dynamic toggling of themes and a menu should be present but makes no assumptions about their specific content or elaborate styling, which you can further develop based on your project's requirements.",

  "cec4120b70b394b4863b68a087210c5d7cadc687514c37600ea15f1c079ddfd9": "Absolutely, I'd be glad to introduce you to the concept of probability! Let's begin with understanding the basics and gradually move into examples and uses.\n\n### Introduction to Probability\n\nProbability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of a given event's occurrence, which is expressed as a number between 0 and 1. An event with a probability of 1 can be considered a certainty, meaning it will always occur, while an event with a probability of 0 is an impossibility, meaning it will never occur.\n\n### Understanding Outcomes\n\nBefore we delve deeper into probability, it is important to understand the term \"outcome.\" An outcome is a possible result of a random process or experiment. For instance, if you roll a six-sided die, possible outcomes include rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n### Types of Events\n\n- **Simple Event:** This is when one outcome directly occurs. For example, rolling a 4 on a die.\n- **Compound Event:** This involves a combination of multiple simple events. For example, rolling a die and getting an even number (2, 4, or 6).\n\n### Calculating Basic Probability\n\nLet‚Äôs say event \\( A \\) is one specific outcome of the experiment. The probability \\( P \\) of an event \\( A \\) occurring is calculated as:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways \\( A \\) can occur}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}}\n\\]\n\n### Example: Rolling a Die\n\nSuppose you roll a fair six-sided die. You want to find the probability of rolling a 4.\n\n- Total outcomes when a die is rolled: 6 (you could roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)\n- The number of ways to roll a 4: 1\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nP(\\text{rolling a 4}) = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n### Example: Drawing a Card\n\nImagine you have a standard deck of playing cards (52 cards total). You want to find the probability of drawing a King.\n\n- Total cards = 52\n- Number of Kings = 4\n\nUsing the probability formula:\n\\[\nP(\\text{drawing a King}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\n### Important Concepts\n\n- **Independent Events:** The outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another. For example, each roll of a die is independent of the other rolls.\n- **Dependent Events:** The outcome of one event does affect the outcome of another. For example, removing a card from a deck affects the outcomes of subsequent draws.\n- **Mutual Exclusivity:** Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. For example, drawing a heart and drawing a club are mutually exclusive events.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Addition Rule:** Probability of the union of two events.\n   \\[\n   P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n   \\]\n   This equation tells us the probability of either event A or event B occurring, subtracting the probability of both A and B occurring together (if they are not mutually exclusive).\n\n2. **Multiplication Rule:** Used for finding the probability of the intersection of two independent events.\n   \\[\n   P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n   \\]\n   This gives the probability of both events A and B occurring.\n\nUsing these basic concepts and rules, you can solve various practical problems involving probability in different fields such as finance, engineering, science, and everyday life scenarios. Probability is not only about gambling; it's a tool for understanding and managing the uncertainty and randomness in systems around us. Keep practicing different problems to get a better intuition on applying these principles effectively!",

Physics is a fascinating field that seeks to understand how the universe behaves. It explores the fundamental principles governing energy, matter, and the interactions between them. We'll start from basics and gradually build up to more complex concepts.\n\n### 1. **What is Physics?**\nPhysics is the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms. Physics is fundamental to our understanding of how the universe operates.\n\n### 2. **Starting with Mechanics**\nMechanics is often the first topic in physics. It deals with motion and the forces that produce motion.\n\n#### **Kinematics**\nKinematics involves the study of motion without considering its causes. Here, you'll learn about:\n- **Displacement**, **Velocity**, and **Acceleration**: Displacement is a change in position. Velocity is speed with a direction, and acceleration is the change in velocity over time.\n\n#### **Dynamics**\nDynamics is concerned with the causes of motion (forces). Newton's laws of motion are central to dynamics:\n- **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\n- **Second Law**: The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. It's often summed up with the formula **F = ma** (Force equals mass times acceleration).\n- **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n### 3. **Energy and Work**\nWork and energy are closely related in physics.\n- **Work** is done when a force applied to an object moves that object. The formula for work is **W = F √ó d** (Work equals force times distance).\n- **Energy** is the capacity to do work. There are various forms of energy: kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, etc.\n\n### 4. **Momentum and Conservation Laws**\nMomentum is a measure of the quantity of motion of a moving body. It's calculated as the product of mass and velocity. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system is constant if no external forces are acting on it.\n\n### 5. **Electromagnetism**\nElectromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of electromagnetic forces, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles.

This distinguishes it from a scalar, which has a magnitude but no direction. Common examples of vectors include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force. Each of these quantities involves not just how much (the magnitude) but also in what direction.\n\n### Components of a Vector\n\n1. **Magnitude**: This is a measure of how large the quantity is. For instance, a vehicle might be moving at 50 kilometers per hour. Here, '50 kilometers per hour' is the magnitude of the velocity vector.\n\n2. **Direction**: This tells us where the vector is aiming or pointing. The direction could be given in terms of angles from certain reference directions (like north, east, south, west) or in relation to an axis (positive or negative x, y, or z directions).\n\n### Representing Vectors\n\nWe can represent vectors in several ways:\n\n- **Graphically**: As an arrow. The length of the arrow depicts the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow depicts the direction of the vector.\n- **Mathematically**: Using coordinates. For example, in a two-dimensional space, a vector can be represented as **v** = (v_x, v_y) where v_x and v_y are components of the vector along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\n\n### Vector Operations\n\nVectors can be added, subtracted, and multiplied in ways that are a bit different from scalar numbers.\n\n#### Addition\nTo add two vectors, you align the tail of the second vector to the head of the first vector. The vector resulting from the tail of the first to the head of the second is the sum of the vectors. Mathematically, if **a** = (a_x, a_y) and **b** = (b_x, b_y), then **a** + **b** = (a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y).\n\n#### Subtraction\nSubtraction of vectors can be thought of as adding a negative vector. To subtract vector **b** from **a** (**a** - **b**), add **a** to the negative of **b**.\n\n#### Multiplication\n1. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the magnitude but not the direction. If k is a scalar, and **v** = (v_x, v_y), then k**v** = (k*v_x, k*v_y).\n   \n2. **Dot Product**: A way to multiply two vectors to yield a scalar. If **a** = (a_x, a_y) and **b** = (b_x, b_y), then the dot product **a** ‚Ä¢ **b** = a_x*b_x + a_y*b_y. This product is useful in finding angles between vectors and in projections.\n\n3. **Cross Product**: Only defined in three dimensions, the result of the cross product of vectors **a** and **b** is a vector perpendicular to both **a** and **b**. Useful in physics for determining torque, force on a charged particle in a magnetic field, etc.\n\n### Importance of Vectors in Physics\n\nVectors are crucial in physics because they accurately describe quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They help predict physical outcomes, resolve vectors into components making problems simpler, and generally help in visualizing physical scenarios mathematically.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding vectors and mastering their operations enables you to tackle complex physical problems by breaking them down into manageable parts. This knowledge will be foundational not just in mechanics but across various areas of physics including electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.",
  "1bd1b5cf15c47ce5f0acb95e9f5510115deca9dde001c169b06deaf56a964cf1": "Certainly! Probability is a fundamental concept not only in statistics but also in physics, where it helps in understanding phenomena in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and many other areas. Let's start from the very basics.\n\n### What is Probability?\n\nProbability measures the likelihood of a certain event happening. It‚Äôs usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means something is impossible, and 1 means it is certain.\n\n### Basic Terms in Probability\n\n1. **Experiment**: An action or process that leads to one or more outcomes. (e.g., flipping a coin)\n   \n2. **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment. (e.g., getting heads or tails)\n\n3. **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n   \n4. **Event**: A subset of the sample space. It's the outcome or a set of outcomes that we are interested in.\n\n### Types of Events\n\n- **Simple Event**: An event consisting of only one outcome (e.g., getting a \"5\" when a die is rolled).\n- **Compound Event**: An event consisting of two or more simple events (e.g., getting an odd number when a die is rolled).\n\n### Calculating Probabilities\n\nThe probability of an event A happening, denoted by P(A), can be calculated by dividing the number of ways event A can occur by the total number of possible outcomes in the sample space.\n\n\\[ P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes for A}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes (Sample Space S)}} \\]\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Rolling a Die\n\nWhen you roll a fair six-sided die, the sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Each outcome has an equal chance of occurring.\n\n- Probability of rolling a 4: \\( P(\\text{4}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n- Probability of rolling an odd number: P(Odd) = P(1, 3, or 5) = \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n#### Example 2: Flipping Two Coins\n\nWhen you flip two coins, the sample space S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} (H for heads, T for tails).\n\n- Probability of getting at least one head: \\( P(\\text{At least one head}) = P(\\text{HH, HT, TH}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\n### Important Rules in Probability\n\n1. **Addition Rule**: If two events, A and B, are mutually exclusive (no outcomes in common), then the probability of A or B is:\n   \n   \\[ P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication Rule**: If two events, A and B, are independent (the occurrence of one does not affect the other), then the probability of A and B is:\n   \n   \\[ P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\]\n\n### Probability in Physics\n\nIn physics:\n\n- Quantum mechanics deeply involves probabilities, particularly in determining the behavior of particles at small scales. For example, the location of an electron around a nucleus can only be described in terms of probabilities.\n- In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, probabilities are used to understand macroscopic properties based on the statistical behavior of microscopic constituents.\n\n### Concluding Thought\n\nUnderstanding probability provides the groundwork for analyzing complex physical systems and various phenomena where randomness and uncertainty arise. As you delve deeper into physics, you will see more sophisticated applications of probability.",

It is used extensively in various fields to make predictions, aid in decision making, and solve practical problems. Let‚Äôs dive in and understand the basics and how they apply, especially from an engineering perspective.\n\n### 1. Fundamentals of Probability Theory\n\n#### 1.1 Definition\n\nProbability measures the chance of occurrence of a specific event. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.\n\n#### 1.2 Sample Space and Events\n\n- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n- **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space, which could include one or more outcomes.\n\nFor example, if you roll a six-faced die, the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. An event might be rolling a number greater than 4, so E = {5, 6}.\n\n#### 1.3 Types of Events\n\n- **Independent Events:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.\n- **Dependent Events:** The occurrence of one event does influence the likelihood of another.\n- **Mutually Exclusive Events:** Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.\n\n#### 1.4 Basic Probability Rules\n\n- **Probability of an Event:** \\( P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in E}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in S}} \\)\n- **Addition Rule:** For two mutually exclusive events, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the probability that \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) will occur is \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \\).\n- **Multiplication Rule:** For two independent events, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the probability that both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) will occur is \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\).\n\n### 2. Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n\n#### 2.1 Conditional Probability\n\nIt expresses how the probability of an event changes if another event is known to occur or has occurred. The formula is defined as:\n\n\\[ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P(A \\mid B) \\) is the probability of \\( A \\) given \\( B \\) has occurred.\n\n#### 2.2 Bayes' Theorem\n\nThis theorem allows you to update the probability of an event based on new information and is widely used in engineering and data science for various predictive models. It is expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n\n### 3. Applications in Engineering\n\nEngineers use probability for risk assessment, quality control, reliability analysis, and decision-making under uncertainty. For example:\n\n- **Reliability Engineering:** Calculating the likelihood that systems or components fail within a specified period.\n- **Quality Control:** Using probability to determine defect rates and the efficacy of quality control processes.\n- **Signal Processing:** In electrical engineering, probabilities help in filtering noise from signals and in robust communication system design.\n\n### 4. Practical Example for Better Understanding\n\n**Question:** Suppose a factory produces bulbs, with a 5% defect rate. If you randomly select 3 bulbs, what is the probability that none are defective?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Probability that one bulb is not defective \\( P(A) = 0.95 \\).\n- Since the selection of bulbs is independent, the combined probability for three non-defective bulbs is \\( P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A) \\times P(A) \\times P(A) = 0.95^3 \\).\n- Compute \\( 0.95^3 = 0.857375 \\).\n\nSo, there's an 85.74% chance that none of the three bulbs will be defective.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding probability allows engineers not only to design and test more efficient systems but also to predict how systems behave under various conditions and make better, data-driven decisions.\n\nThis overview should give you a functional foundation in probability theory, with pointers on how these principles are applied practically in engineering fields.",

I'm excited to teach you about waves, which are fundamental concepts in physics and critical to understanding many natural phenomena and technologies.\n\n### What is a Wave?\n\nIn physics, **a wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another without transferring matter**. Waves can propagate through different mediums, such as air, water, or even empty space, depending on their type.\n\n### Types of Waves\n\nWaves are classified into several types based on their characteristics:\n\n1. **Mechanical Waves**: These waves require a medium to travel through. They can be further divided into:\n   - **Transverse Waves**: In these waves, the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of the wave's travel. Examples include waves on a string, water waves, and seismic S-waves.\n   - **Longitudinal Waves**: Here, the displacement of the medium is parallel to the direction of the wave's travel. Sound waves and seismic P-waves are examples of longitudinal waves.\n\n2. **Electromagnetic Waves**: These do not require a medium and can travel through the vacuum of space. Light, radio waves, X-rays, and microwaves are all examples of electromagnetic waves.\n\n3. **Matter Waves**: Postulated in quantum mechanics, these waves describe the wave-like behavior of particles. The de Broglie hypothesis is a key concept here, proposing that all matter exhibits wave-like properties.\n\n### Key Properties of Waves\n\nTo understand waves better, let‚Äôs define some of their key properties:\n\n1. **Wavelength (Œª)**: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs in a wave.\n2. **Frequency (f)**: The number of crests that pass a fixed point per unit time. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).\n3. **Amplitude (A)**: The maximum displacement of a point on the wave from its rest position, indicating the wave's energy.\n4. **Speed (v)**: How fast the wave propagates through a medium. The relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength is given by the equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\).\n\n5. **Period (T)**: The time it takes for one complete wave cycle to pass. It is related to frequency by \\( T = \\frac{1}{f} \\).\n\n### Wave Behavior\n\nWaves exhibit various behaviors when they encounter different media or obstacles, including:\n\n- **Reflection**: When a wave bounces back after hitting a barrier.\n- **Refraction**: When a wave bends as it enters a new medium at an angle.\n- **Diffraction**: The bending and spreading of waves around obstacles and openings.\n- **Interference**: When two waves overlap, they can constructively (amplify each other) or destructively (cancel each other out) interfere, resulting in new wave patterns.\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nUnderstanding waves has led to numerous technological advancements and insights across various fields:\n- **Communications**: Radio and TV broadcasts rely on electromagnetic waves.\n- **Medical Field**: Ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the body.\n- **Physics and Engineering**: Understanding seismic waves helps in studying earthquakes and designing safer buildings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWaves are an intrinsic part of the universe, from the smallest quantum particles to the vastness of interstellar communication.

As you're starting your journey in the field of accountancy while studying as a 100-level student, it's important to build a strong foundation. Here, I'll guide you through the basics of accounting, including its purpose, principles, and the key concepts you will encounter.\n\n### 1. **Introduction to Accounting**\nAccounting is often referred to as the \"language of business\" because it provides key financial information about a business or an individual's financial transactions to various users such as investors, managers, and regulatory agencies, to help them make informed decisions.\n\n### 2. **Branches of Accounting**\n- **Financial Accounting**: This focuses on recording day-to-day transactions, preparing financial statements like the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement that reflect the company's performance over a specific period.\n- **Management Accounting**: This area of accounting focuses on providing information within the organization so that management can make informed operational decisions.\n- **Cost Accounting**: A subset of management accounting, cost accounting involves recording, analyzing, and reporting all of a company's costs (both variable and fixed) related to the production of a product.\n- **Tax Accounting**: Focuses on preparation, analysis, and planning of tax returns and payments.\n\n### 3. **Basic Accounting Principles**\nHere are some fundamental principles that govern the practice of accounting:\n- **Accrual Principle**: This principle dictates that transactions should be recorded at the time they occur, not necessarily when cash is exchanged. This helps in knowing the actual expense and revenue during a specific period.\n- **Consistency Principle**: Ensures that the company uses the same accounting principles and methods from year to year.\n- **Going Concern Principle**: Assumes the business will continue operating instead of being closed or sold, affecting decisions in financial reporting.\n\n### 4. **Key Accounting Concepts**\n- **Assets**: Resources owned by a business (e.g., cash, inventory, buildings).\n- **Liabilities**: Obligations or debts that a company owes (e.g., loans, accounts payable).\n- **Equity**: Also known as owner‚Äôs equity, it represents the owner's claim after all liabilities have been subtracted from assets.\n- **Revenues**: The earnings from providing services or selling goods.\n- **Expenses**: The costs incurred to generate revenue.\n\n### 5. **The Accounting Equation**\nOne of the most basic, yet profound concepts in accounting is the Accounting Equation:\n\\[ \\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Equity} \\]\nThis equation must always be balanced and forms the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping.\n\n### 6. **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**\n- For every transaction, two entries must be made: one debit and one credit. The total debits must equal total credits.\n- **Debit (Dr)**: Typically, increases in assets or expenses and decreases in liabilities or equity.\n- **Credit (Cr)**: Typically, decreases in assets or expenses and increases in liabilities or equity.\n\n### 7. **Financial Statements**\n- **Balance Sheet**: Provides a snapshot of a company‚Äôs financial condition at a single point in time.\n- **Income Statement**: Shows revenues and expenses through either profit or loss over a period of time.\n- **Cash Flow Statement**: Analyzes the changes in cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving the company.\n\n### 8. **Studying Tips for Accountancy Students**\n- **Understand the theory**: Approach your study with an interest in understanding why and how things work in accounting, not just memorization.\n- **Practice regularly**: Work through as many example problems as possible to become fluent in the concepts.\n- **Stay Updated**: As you progress, keep an eye on new developments in accounting standards and technology.\n\nBy mastering the basic concepts and principles outlined here, you'll be well on your way to excelling in your accounting studies and future career. Remember, the key to proficiency in accounting is persistent practice and further learning. Good luck!",

It is a vast field that explores the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things. It also looks at how different life forms interact with each other and with their environments.\n\nThe word \"biology\" comes from the Greek words \"bios\" meaning life and \"logia\" meaning study. As a branch of science, biology is divided into various sub-disciplines that focus on specific aspects of biological inquiry. Here are a few key areas:\n\n1. **Botany** - the study of plants\n2. **Zoology** - the study of animals\n3. **Microbiology** - the study of microscopic organisms\n4. **Genetics** - the study of genes and heredity\n5. **Ecology** - the study of ecosystems and how organisms interact with their environment\n6. **Evolutionary Biology** - explores the processes that produced the diversity of life\n7. **Cell Biology** - the study of the structure and function of cells\n\nBiology is crucial in helping us understand the natural world and how the many forms of life on Earth function, grow, and interact. Insights from biological research can lead to advances in medicine, environmental conservation, agriculture, and many other areas that influence daily life. Biology also addresses some of the biggest challenges facing humanity, such as climate change, global health issues, and conservation of biodiversity."
